/* "THE LUNCH-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 1)
/* Jean-Francois Arseneau <jf.arseneau@gmail.com> wrote this file. As long as you
/* retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. This license 
/* is a fork of Poul-Henning Kamp's beer-ware license. I don't drink,
/* but I love all kinds of food. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff
/* is worth it, you can buy me lunch in return.
